# PasswordGenerator

## Overview

The purpose of this application is to exercise the Javascript concepts that me learned in class. These include Objects, Functions, Variables, Loops and Event Listeners. 


## Usage 

This password generator can be used to create a randomized password that falls within the qualifications specified by the user. Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, the user will be given a window promt asking how many characters they would like the password to be, and will then cycle through several prompts asking if the user would like a particular type of character in the password. If the user selects no character type at all, or gives a length specification that is more or less than the length limit (8-128 characters), they will recieve an error that they cannot proceed. 

The generated password will then show up in the box in the center of the screen and can be copied.
